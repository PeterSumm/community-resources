This watch face is a derivative work from the Pebble tutorials, and now displays the following:

	- time, 
	- date, 
	- temperature, 
	- weather conditions, 
	- winds speed and (when applicable) gust, 
	- bluetooth links status (0 or 1), 
	- battery status (0-10), 
	- phase of the moon (0-29 days, 0 is a new moon, 14 a full moon);
	- location of the moon in the sky (0-99 roughly fifteen-minute intervals).

The moon location is accurate to a standard deviation of about five minutes, but the offset will depend on your location and time zone.  In Melbourne, Australia, 0 corresponds to the moon on the opposite side of the earth and 50 to its being directly overhead.  You can use this number to make a rough estimate of tides if you observe a few tide times and work out the offsets of the two high and two low tides that will, in most parts of the world, occur within this period.

In a future release I'll make the app configurable and will allow the user to choose tweak this offset and choose the units of measure (currently celsius and km/h).

If you make any enhancements to this, please send me a copy.

Enjoy!
